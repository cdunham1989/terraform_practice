# Terraform Practice

For my first role after makers I worked as part of a small agency in London called Infinity Works. My time there focussed mainly on AWS and Terraform.   

In this repository I have included:

- One of the more in depth tutorials I completed when I was learning to use these tools.   
- A model system I created as part of my learning process. This involved a few more advanced techniques including using multiple AWS regions and the effective use of modules and variables within terraform.

This is only the start of the work I completed during my time there but it gives an indication of what things I covered and what I learned while I was there.

# Terraform Practice

For my first role after makers I worked as part of a small agency in London called Infinity Works. My time there focussed mainly on AWS and Terraform.   

In this repository I have included:

- One of the more in depth tutorials I completed when I was learning to use these tools.

- A model system I created as part of my learning process. This involved a few more advanced techniques including using multiple AWS regions, the use of docker and the effective use of modules and variables within terraform.

This is only the start of the work I completed during my time there but it gives an indication of what things I covered and what I learned while I was there.
